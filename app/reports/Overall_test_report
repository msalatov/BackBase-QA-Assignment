The application has two critical defects:
-The application is crashing when orientation changes to landscape.
-Map cannot be loaded and city cannot be shown on the map.
It should be fixed as soon as possible because it may have a big impact on user feeling of the application.

Storing cities data in cities.json file doesn't look like proper way.
It makes application heavier and more demanding.

Alphabetic sorting ignores country.
Thus, cities list doesn't look well-sorted.
Searching can be awkward because of that.

Also, searching can be inconvenient due to the lack of search by name and country.
Searching by name and country returns empty result.

Cities list contains cities with the same name and country.
Duplicates should be removed and cities names should be more descriptive(region or coordinates can be added).

The main purpose of tests is to cover all acceptance criteria and main functionality.

#Suggestions:
- For proper sorting can be created Comparator with name as a first key and country as a second key.
- Map issue cause: maybe API key has some restrictions or Maps SDK for Android is disabled or limit of free requests are exceeded.
- Delete duplicates: Set can be used for collecting cities and equals should be override(e.g. use coordinates for comparison).
- Cities data can be loaded from server.
- For testing Map functionality follow next steps:
    Open https://console.cloud.google.com/
    In APIs & Services click Library
    Find Maps SDK for Android and enable it
    In Credentials create new API key
    And put it in AndroidManifest.xml android:value
